Dear Supplier,

After reviewing recent product replacements, we found that '{most_quality_product}' stands out as the item with the highest number of quality-related complaints ({most_quality_count} cases).

We kindly request your team to investigate potential causes in the production process and propose improvements to reduce these issues. Please let us know if you need additional data or support from our side.

Best regards,  
Guilherme AntÃ´nio Silva
