# PyTorch PCA Feature Selection

This directory contains examples and materials related to the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for **dimensionality reduction** and **feature selection**, applied to a **classification task** using **PyTorch**.

## Files

- **Full_PCA_Feature_Selection_Guide.pdf**  
  A document explaining the theory behind PCA and how it can be used for feature selection.

- **pca_pytorch_wine_classification.py**  
  A Python script that:
  - Loads and preprocesses the dataset
  - Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction
  - Trains a simple neural network using PyTorch

- **pca_pytorch_wine_classification.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook version of the script, enabling step-by-step execution and visualization of the process.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization in the notebook)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of:

- Applying PCA to reduce the number of features in a dataset
- Selecting the most relevant features
- Training a simple neural network classifier using PyTorch on the transformed dataset

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
